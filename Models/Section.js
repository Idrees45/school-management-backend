  // s, youâ€™re correct! In the setup you described, the relationships are managed by storing individual entities (Teacher, Class, Section, and Subject) 
  // in their own collections  and then linking them through references in a central TeachingAssignment collection.
  //  This type of relationship is commonly referred to as a "many-to-many relationship
  //  with an intermediary model" or "junction table" (in relational databases).
